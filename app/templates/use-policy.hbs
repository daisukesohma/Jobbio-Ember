                  <ol>
                    <li> Chat rooms. </li>
                    <li> Bulletin boards. </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p> Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind
                    of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is
                    human or technical). </p>
                  <p> We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users from third parties when they use any
                    interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate
                    to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of
                    those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service
                    we provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the
                    use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service
                    is moderated or not. </p>
                  <p> Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting
                    the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise. </p>
