                    <p><strong>1.3 Changes to the Privacy Notice and your duty to inform us of changes</strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data protection law in Ireland will change on 25 May 2018. Although this Privacy Notice sets out most of your rights under the new laws, we may not yet be able to respond to some of your
                        requests (for example, a request for the transfer of your personal data) until May 2018 as we are still working towards getting our systems ready for some of these changes. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</span></p>

                  <p><b>Request access:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are
                      lawfully processing it.</span></p>
                  <p><b>Request correction:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the
                      accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</span></p>
                  <p><b>Request erasure:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to
                      ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
                      personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

                  <p><b>Object to processing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you
                      want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some
                      cases, we may demonstrate that we have a compelling legitimate ground to process your information which overrides your rights and freedoms.</span></p>
                  <p><b>Request restriction of processing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to
                      establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend
                      legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. </span></p>
                  <p><b>Request the transfer:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
